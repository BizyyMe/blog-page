  Welcome ! ----- I am working on the completion of a website that is to grow continously. 

      HTML , CSS3 , JS | considering scss, and whether to use node.js , | considering react.
      Backend will probably be some server side Javascript and whatever else I explore in to
      that can offer enhancements where needed.

Just a basic notice, and simple informative. Looking for assistance though, so please feel free to show me changes, or implement ideas.
